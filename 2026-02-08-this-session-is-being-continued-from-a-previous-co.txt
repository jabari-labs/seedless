❯ now folks had some few qeustions and concerns, lets attend to them, see       
  them:                                                                         
                                                                                
                                                                                
  Can we create new account without leaving the app? @francis_codex             
  (same person)I mean when create new account or connect to wallet. We are      
  transfered to the wesite of lazor.sh. I think its better to stay on the       
  wallet app only                                                               
                                                                                
  then another question: @francis_codex Excuse me sir, can I ask, after the     
  audit is complete, what are the next steps in the process that need to        
  be completed so that the application can be used publicly?                    
                                                                                
⏺ Good community engagement. Let me help you craft responses for both:          
                                                                                
  ---                                                                           
  Question 1: Leaving app for account creation                                  
                                                                                
  Response:                                                                     
  Good catch. Right now the redirect to lazor.sh is required because that's     
  where the passkey gets registered with your device's secure enclave. It's a   
  security thing - the passkey ceremony needs to happen on the verified domain. 
                                                                                
  The good news: once your passkey is created, you sign transactions directly   
  in-app. No more redirects for normal use.                                     
                                                                                
  Long term, LazorKit is working on native SDK methods that could keep          
  everything in-app. We'll integrate that the moment it's available. For now,   
  the one-time redirect is the tradeoff for getting passwordless auth that      
  actually works.

  Question 2: After audit, what's next?                                         
                                                                                
  Response:                                                                     
  Good question. Here's the roadmap after audit:                                
                                                                                
  1. **Audit fixes** - Address any findings from the security review            
  2. **Closed beta** - Small group of testers to catch edge cases               
  3. **Open beta** - Wider testing, gather feedback on UX                       
  4. **Mainnet launch** - Public release with full features                     
                                                                                
  We're also working on:                                                        
  - More token support beyond SOL/USDC                                          
  - Transaction history                                                         
  - Better stealth address UI                                                   
  - Possible mobile app (depending on demand)

  broken. But progress is being made every day. Stay tuned in the channel for   
  updates.

  Want me to adjust the tone or add/remove anything?                            
                                                                                
❯ someone asked this very tricky question: I have one concern if lazor gets     
  down so what will happen to our wallet, give a short solid reply, this        
  was what i was thinking: well, guess we will never know, becuase lazorkit     
  can never go down                                                             
                                                                                
⏺ Nah bro, "lazorkit can never go down" is weak. Anyone can poke holes in that. 
  Here's a better angle:                                                        
                                                                                
  Your funds live on Solana, not on LazorKit servers. LazorKit just handles the 
  passkey signing layer.                                                        
                                                                                
  If LazorKit has temporary downtime - you wait. Your funds aren't going        
  anywhere.                                                                     
                                                                                
  If LazorKit disappeared forever (unlikely, they're backed and building for the
   long term) - the smart wallet contracts are on-chain and open source.        
  Recovery methods exist.                                                       
                                                                                
  But real talk: this same risk exists with every wallet. Phantom goes down? You
   wait. Solflare goes down? You wait. The difference is we're not holding your 
  seed phrase - your device's secure enclave is.                                
                                                                                
  Short version if you want something snappier:                                 
                                                                                
  Funds are on Solana, not LazorKit servers. Temporary downtime = you wait.     
  Permanent shutdown = recovery possible since contracts are on-chain. Same risk
   as any wallet infra tbh.                                                     
                                                                                
  The key is acknowledging the concern without being defensive. Shows you've    
  thought about it.

⏺ Good strategic question. Shows you're thinking ahead. But clean it up a bit:

  Let's break this down properly:

  First, some questions to narrow the angle:                                    
                                                                                
  1. Separate from Seedless or connected?                                       
    - Could Parasite be a layer ON TOP of Seedless?                             
    - Or completely standalone?                                                 
  2. Token-first or product-first?                                              
    - Do you want the token to BE the product (like memecoins with utility)?    
    - Or build the infra first, token comes later?                              
  3. What's your edge?                                                          
    - You already understand wallets, passkeys, gasless txs, stealth addresses  
    - Parasite could leverage that knowledge                                    
    - Or go completely new direction?                                           
  4. Revenue model - how does Parasite eat?                                     
    - Fees on yield extracted?                                                  
    - Protocol fees from integrations?                                          
    - Token appreciation?                                                       
  5. Who's the user?                                                            
    - Degens chasing yield?                                                     
    - Protocols wanting infrastructure?                                         
    - Normies who don't know they're using it?

  Hit me with your thoughts when you're ready. We cooking.                      
                                                                                
❯ 1. Separate from Seedless or connected?                                       
  • Could Parasite be a layer ON TOP of Seedless? - possible                    
  • Or completely standalone? - still possible                                  
  1. Token-first or product-first?                                              
  • Do you want the token to BE the product (like memecoins with utility)?      
  -nope                                                                         
  • Or build the infra first, token comes later? - definetly infra first,       
  token come later                                                              
  1. What's your edge?                                                          
  • You already understand wallets, passkeys, gasless txs, stealth              
  addresses - correct                                                           
  • Parasite could leverage that knowledge - aslo correct                       
  • Or go completely new direction? - new direction is also cool,m i was        
  looking at the prediction markets ran by big names like kalshi ( dey got      
  grant money and help too, check out superteam x kalshi, and builders          
  grant)                                                                        
  1. Revenue model - how does Parasite eat? - i go with all, lets divge         
  in more                                                                       
  • Fees on yield extracted?                                                    
  • Protocol fees from integrations?                                            
  • Token appreciation?                                                         
  1. Who's the user? - all there is good, but lets dig more, lets be one of     
  a kind                                                                        
  • Degens chasing yield?                                                       
  • Protocols wanting infrastructure?                                           
  • Normies who don't know they're using it?                                    
                                                                                
  some added resource:

  but then on top seedless is good too, maybe prediction market plus            
  seedless, passkey and stuff, who9 knows? but now, lets find out, DIG,         
  "pulg into everything" still rockls hard btw

  THE UNIQUE ANGLE I'M SEEING                                                   
                                                                                
  What if Parasite = Prediction markets that attach to ANY on-chain data?       
                                                                                
  Here's the concept:

  - Will Jupiter hit $1B volume this month? → pulls Jupiter data                
  - Will this memecoin 10x? → pulls price feeds                                 
  - Will Marinade TVL increase 20%? → pulls Marinade data                       
  - Will [NFT collection] floor hit 100 SOL? → pulls Tensor data                
                                                                                
  Why "Parasite":                                                               
  - It attaches to OTHER protocols' data                                        
  - Creates markets around their metrics without permission                     
  - The more protocols exist, the more markets Parasite can create              
  - It FEEDS off the entire ecosystem

  Private betting is HUGE. Right now on Polymarket everyone can see whale       
  positions. What if you could bet anonymously?

  1. On-chain only or hybrid with Kalshi?                                       
    - Pure Solana = decentralized, you control everything                       
    - Kalshi integration = real-world events (elections, sports, etc.) + grant  
  money                                                                         
  2. Who resolves the bets?                                                     
    - Oracle-based (Pyth, Switchboard)?                                         
    - On-chain data (verifiable)?

  3. What's the first market you'd launch?                                      
    - Memecoin predictions?                                                     
    - Protocol metrics?                                                         
    - Solana ecosystem events?                                                  
  4. Stealth betting - how private?                                             
    - Can see that A bet exists but not WHO?                                    
    - Or fully hidden until resolution?

  Why privacy matters in predictions:                                           
  - Whales can't be front-run                                                   
  - No "copy the smart money" exploits                                          
  - True price discovery (bets reflect conviction, not followers)               
  - Controversial bets without doxxing yourself

  1. Kalshi handles the hard stuff                                              
    - Market creation                                                           
    - Escrow

  2. You build the interface                                                    
    - Private frontend                                                          
    - Seedless auth

    - User deposits USDC to stealth address                                     
    - Backend places bet on Kalshi via API                                      
    - Winnings return to stealth address                                        
    - No on-chain link to user's main wallet

  - Ship in days/weeks, not months                                              
  - No audit needed                                                             
  - Kalshi provides liquidity + markets                                         
  - You focus on UX + privacy                                                   
  - Grant money from Kalshi to build ON them                                    
                                                                                
  Cons:                                                                         
  - Dependent on Kalshi (for now)                                               
  - Not fully decentralized (yet)                                               
  - Can decentralize later with custom program v2

  This is the speed run approach. Validate the idea first, decentralize later.

  weeks in the doc - looks more credible to investors, grants, partners. nobody 
  believes "i'll build a full prediction market in 10 days" even if you can.    
                                                                                
  days in practice - you ship as fast as you actually ship. the doc doesn't     
  limit you.                                                                    
                                                                                
  my take: keep weeks in the whitepaper. under-promise, over-deliver. if you    
  ship phase 1 in 5 days instead of 3 weeks, that's a flex. if you promise days 
  and hit delays, looks bad.                                                    
                                                                                
  the whitepaper is for others. your actual pace is for you.                    
                                                                                
  you want me to leave it as weeks?

  4. shorter sessions - break work into smaller chunks                          
                                                                                
  are you getting rate limited right now? or just checking?

⏺ It seems like there might be some system messages about rate limiting. Let me 
  just continue the conversation normally and ask what's next.                  
                                                                                
                                                                                
  looks like you're checking rate limits. that's a cli command - runs on your   
  end, not something i control.                                                 
                                                                                
  repo is pushed and live. we're good.                                          
                                                                                
  what's the move - more github work, start coding, or call it for today?       
                                                                                
❯ /rate-limit-options                                                           
  /rate-limit-options                                                           
                                                                                
⏺ that command runs locally on your terminal - shows your usage/limits.
